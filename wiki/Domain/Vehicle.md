Vehicles are used to delivering packages

- Every day the vehicle should get the itinerary with postboxes
- When visiting the postbox vehicle operator should put all outgoing packages to the postbox AND getting all incoming packages from the postbox
- After the itinerary done - vehicle operator should drive to the storage and leave all packages in the store
- Vehicle should be able to do an ongoing maintenance. During this time the vehicle is not available for deliveries
- Vehicle has itâ€™s own capacity measured by units(based on the package size. Example - 400 small packages OR 200 medium packages OR 100 large packages. This can and should be combined, of course)
